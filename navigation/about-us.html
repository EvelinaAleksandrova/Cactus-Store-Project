    About Us
</h1>
<p>
    Growing cactuses and succulents since 1999 I managed to collect good amount of astrophytum plants, gymnocalycium, copiapoa, ferocactus plants and many others. Then I focused on succulents and mesemb plants and at the end built a new greenhouse for aloe, haworthias and caudex plants. These days I have about 100 000 plants in my collection and offer good range of haworthia plants, lithops, conophytums, aloe, echeveria, crassula, adromischus plants and big range of astrophytum hybrids, gymnocalycium seedlings, neoporterias, thelocephala seedlings and many others.

    In 2015 I moved from Ukraine to Bulgaria with my collection and since then started to develop my hobby as a business.

    Since 2018 I have a team of professionals working with me to support our online shop and plants care. Mariela Miteva, Sabina Paraskova, Dimitar Stoychev and Yaroslav Avekin – it is our team of professional growers and sales managers.

    Also we offer a good range of cactus-related souvenirs.

    We ship plants worldwide (the only 2 countries are in my exception list – Singapore and Australia, I’m really sorry for it). I offer registered airmail delivery with phyto certificate (13 euro per box for non- EU countries).

    Fast delivery, good packaging, healthy plants. It is our motto and standard.

    Our team – is a friendly collective, which in the 3 years grew to 9 people and became a family,where everyone is helping each other and happy about teams successes and achievements, and who are listening to the clients feedback.

    We are open to everything new and interesting, every month we improve our collection in our greenhouse with new and exciting plants and make our clients happy by giving them an opportunity to build a unique collection of their own, starting with cactuses and succulents up to begonias and bonsais.
